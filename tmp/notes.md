Can you draft for me a prompt to instruct GH Copilot Plan Agent to create aa plan to build the following: 
I want to build a very simple web application where on the left side of the screen I have an avatar of a soccer player, and on the right side of the screen I have multiple drop down boxes where I can choose how to dress this avatar with the shoes, the the t-shirt and the pants. And I want to build this with plain JavaScript (no framework can be used) and basically with HTML and some CSS (no frameworks).
Here you can find the base avatar image: #,,,
I need to make sure that my implementation contains:
- JSON files for the dropdown color options
- there needs to be basic javascript functionality, like an if statement or a loop
- every function needs to have a clear description on top of what functionality it encapsulates
- when I chose a different color from a dropdown field, the change needs to be applied via javascript (dom changes in js)
- There needs to be a wizard (with a back functionality) to go from one dropdown to the other
- there needs to be a button which would randomly chose colors for each part (shirt, pants, shoes)
